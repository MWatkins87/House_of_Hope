# Project3_Group1 - House of Hope

## Define the Problem

Our project group is focused on enhancing the success rates of addiction and recovery treatment programs utilized by facilities such as the House of Hope, which currently works with female clients. With only 42.1% of patients completing their treatment programs, we aim to identify and analyze key factors that contribute to higher or lower completion rates.

Our immediate goal is to develop a predictive model based on intake questionnaires to improve predictions of client success rates. By incorporating a neural network, specifically a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), we aim to increase the accuracy of these predictions by capturing complex patterns in the data.

Looking ahead, we plan to train our model to recommend strategies that can significantly improve patient retention and success, thereby increasing the overall effectiveness and impact of these crucial treatment programs. As the facility expands operations, we will also consider the inclusion of dormitories for male clients, ensuring our solutions are scalable and inclusive.

## Data collection

### Dataset 1

https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/samhda-substance-abuse-and-mental-health-data-archive
samhsa.gov
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive
Get Access: NSDUH Restricted-use Data SAMHSA has partnered with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to host restricted-use National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data at their Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (RDCs). RDCs are secure facilities that provide access to a range of restricted-use microdata for statistical purposes. SAMHSA is the most recent federal partner to work with NCHS in making NSDUH restricted-use microdata available to approved researchers at RDC sites.
