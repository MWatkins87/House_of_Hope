# Project3_Group1 - House of Hope

## Abstract

This project aims to enhance the success rates of addiction and recovery treatment programs at facilities like the Green County House of Hope. Currently, only 42.1% of residents at the House of Hope complete their treatment programs. By identifying and analyzing key factors that influence completion rates, the project seeks to direct limited resources towards residents most likely to successfully complete the program.

The first objective is to develop an intake questionnaire that will screen prospective residents and predict their probability of treatment completion. This questionnaire will capture crucial data points to inform predictions and include filters to ethically evaluate residents by comparing them to similar individuals with known outcomes.

Previous models developed for the House of Hope employed various machine learning techniques, with the most accurate results coming from Random Forest models. This project aims to improve prediction accuracy by utilizing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Deep Neural Network (DNN), which can capture more complex patterns in the data.

The Green County House of Hope also plans to expand its operations to include services for men. To support this expansion, the project will leverage the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive dataset, which includes data on male residents. By sorting the data by gender, the project will enable more accurate predictions for the current female resident population and future male residents.

## Green County House of Hope Background

The Green County House of Hope was established in 2020 by Paul Watkins, a former jail chaplain who also served at the Green County Drug Court in Monroe, Wisconsin. Watkins founded the House of Hope with the vision of providing women a safe and stable environment for recovery from addiction, free from the triggers that might cause a relapse.

To be considered for residency, prospective residents must be at least 18 years old and have been in recovery for a minimum of 90 days. The selection process involves an interview with the House of Hope Committee, which evaluates candidates and selects women to join the program.

Residents at the House of Hope are required to participate in group therapy sessions, such as Narcotics Anonymous, and must be either employed or actively attending job training. Daily support group participation is also mandatory, fostering a supportive community atmosphere.

The House of Hope is designed to support a maximum of four women simultaneously, allowing for intensive, personalized services. Residents can stay as long as needed to achieve independence and sustain long-term sobriety.

While many drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs have success rates of just 10%, the Green County House of Hope stands out with results exceeding four times that of typical programs. This remarkable success can be attributed to its small, personalized approach, which allows for intensive, individualized support. To further enhance their effectiveness, the House of Hope is planning to incorporate a data-driven component into their selection process. This will enable them to identify and select residents who are most likely to benefit from the program, thereby optimizing their resources and improving overall outcomes.

## Data collection

Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive
Get Access: NSDUH Restricted-use Data SAMHSA has partnered with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to host restricted-use National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data at their Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (RDCs). RDCs are secure facilities that provide access to a range of restricted-use microdata for statistical purposes. SAMHSA is the most recent federal partner to work with NCHS in making NSDUH restricted-use microdata available to approved researchers at RDC sites.
